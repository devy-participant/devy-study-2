# Devy Study Task 2

Complete the following tasks.
  1. Say "Alexa, tell Devy to list my issues." to list the first open issue on GitHub. List the second issue by saying "Next", then stop by saying "Stop". Notice that the listed issues are for the correct repository.
  2. Say "Alexa, tell Devy I want to work on issue 2." to have Devy prepare your workspace for you by checking out a new branch.
  3. Resolve the issue: comment out the debug `console.log` on line 8 of log.ts by prepending it with `//`. Save the file.
  4. Say "Alexa, tell Devy I'm done." followed by "Yes" and "Yes" then "No" and finally "Yes". This will commit your work and open a pull request.

Notice that the reviewers you specified have been added. Also, notice that tests covering the changes were automatically run and the results included as a comment by Devy.
